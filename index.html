            Snoozecrow is an ambient music producer who also happens to be a
            crow. When the headphones go on, he escapes to a world of endless
            ocean, where inspiration bobs from the depths when it’s time to be
            used in the form of living islands. <br />
            Snoozecrow is an immersive low poly 3D music experience born from
            the love of gaming and atmospheric music. Snoozecrow builds a
            digital context that continues to grow with each song. It’s an
            experience that grows with each single, breaking free from the
            limits of the standard music release model. <br />'Progress is
            Progress' is the first title, and the world to go with it is in the
            process of being built. Soon you’ll be able to row to its island,
            touch land and explore the sound as Snoozecrow on foot.

              <summary>What do we do?</summary>
              <p>
                From conceptualisation, design, development, to editing and
                publishing. We translate your online idea into its very best
                version, based on your budget.
              </p>

              <summary>What do you produce?</summary>
              <p>
                We believe a website communicates the most important things
                about you, and should be treated with the same dedication to
                detail to match. Tell us what you need your audience to know, we
                make sure it gets delivered in the most engaging way, with
                clear, meaningful and memorable messaging. To tell your
                business’s journey, we provide the highway and the car, i.e. the
                story and the world it lives in
              </p>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary>What do you do differently?</summary>
              <p>
                We focus on small projects that need the fully bespoke treatment
                to deliver an interactive experience to their audience. We don’t
                use bloat or templates and we go straight to the core of the
                message. We then add the branding, graphics and media that will
                drive the point home, in your own voice.
              </p>

            <details>
              <summary>Can’t I do it with an online builder?</summary>
              <p>
                What you gain in speed and convenience of a builder you lose in
                flexibility and clarity. It’s true that websites need to be
                maintainable and succinct to keep up with our social media
                driven world. So, we ensure we understand the core of your
                business so we can create stripped down, dynamic, maintainable
                websites that get to the point in an aesthetically exciting
                fashion.

            <details>
              <summary>What if we need more than something simple?</summary>
              <p>
                We’re equipped for that. Bigger experiences require lots of
                planning and a robust framework, so we take stock of what you
                want and provide a quote after an initial prototype stage, once
                we’ve analysed what is necessary for the minimal viable product.

            </details>
            <details>
              <summary>Do you use AI graphics and media?</summary>
              <p>
                Absolutely not. With a decade of combined experience in software
                development, music, graphic design, and dedication to artistic
                development, we have the skills to give you a real, breathing
                website with nuance and heart. Just like an online builder, AI
                is an echo of every other website, useful for quick tasks, but
                charmless in the long term. We’re offering something spontaneous
                that reflects you and your team, so you stand out for who you
                are.
