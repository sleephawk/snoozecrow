                <p>
                    We are Matt Wright (Snoozecrow Studio) and Ruben Madila (By Madila).
                    We collaborate on projects that require a fully bespoke approach to
                    deliver visual experiences on the web.

                <h3><strong>SNOOZECROW STUDIO</strong></h3>
                <p>
                    Matt: “Snoozecrow Studio is an experienced-focused multimedia
                    creative studio that combines my accumulated creative industry
                    experience into digital solutions that feel like miniature worlds.
                    Trained in music, design, PR and software development, I look for
                    the narrative in your brand and enhance it with the assets you need
                    to make it real, without any reliance on AI slop. On top of that, I
                    provide reliable infrastructure for your project, be it clean
                    polygons in 3D art, clean and accessible code for frontend in JS, TS
                    or React, clean stems from your soundtrack or clean SVGs for your
                    logo. Snoozecrow Studio has the tools you need to make your vision
                    flourish, by providing all the magic you need in the background to
                    project it proudly to your audience.”
                </p>
                <h3><strong>BY MADILA</strong></h3>
                <p>
                    Ruben: "By Madila is a new outlet that allows me to partner up with amazing creatives to subvert the
                    power dynamics created by big tech. With the advent of generic subscription services that promise a
                    "one-size-fits-all" approach to anything now a days, we have forgotten that your brand should always
                    be your authenticity. Where social media and SaaS (Subscription as a service) platforms ultimately
                    require you to stick to what THEY do best in order to thrive, we offer a solution that allows you to
                    focus on what YOU do best by creating affordable bespoke solutions that can last decades without
                    tying you up to fees that will keep increasing while removing what makes you unique."

                                Snoozecrow is an ambient music producer who also happens to be a
                                crow. When the headphones go on, he escapes to a world of endless
                                ocean, where inspiration bobs from the depths when it’s time to be
                                used in the form of living islands.</p>
                            <p>Snoozecrow is an immersive low poly 3D music experience born from
                                the love of gaming and atmospheric music. Snoozecrow builds a
                                digital context that continues to grow with each song. It’s an
                                experience that grows with each single, breaking free from the
                                limits of the standard music release model.</p>
                            <p>'Progress is
                                Progress' is the first title, and the world to go with it is in the
                                process of being built. Soon you’ll be able to row to its island,
                                touch land and explore the sound as Snoozecrow on foot.

                        <p>
                            From conceptualisation, design, development, to editing and
                            publishing. We translate your online idea into its very best
                            version, based on your budget.

                        <p>
                            We believe a website communicates the most important things
                            about you, and should be treated with the same dedication to
                            detail to match. Tell us what you need your audience to know, we
                            make sure it gets delivered in the most engaging way, with
                            clear, meaningful and memorable messaging. To tell your
                            business’s journey, we provide the highway and the car, i.e. the
                            story and the world it lives in
                        </p>

                        <summary>What do you do differently?</summary>
                        <p>
                            We focus on small projects that need the fully bespoke treatment
                            to deliver an interactive experience to their audience. We don’t
                            use bloat or templates and we go straight to the core of the
                            message. We then add the branding, graphics and media that will
                            drive the point home, in your own voice.

                        <summary>Can’t I do it with an online builder?</summary>
                        <p>
                            What you gain in speed and convenience of a builder you lose in
                            flexibility and clarity. It’s true that websites need to be
                            maintainable and succinct to keep up with our social media
                            driven world. So, we ensure we understand the core of your
                            business so we can create stripped down, dynamic, maintainable
                            websites that get to the point in an aesthetically exciting
                            fashion.

                        <summary>What if we need more than something simple?</summary>
                        <p>
                            We’re equipped for that. Bigger experiences require lots of
                            planning and a robust framework, so we take stock of what you
                            want and provide a quote after an initial prototype stage, once
                            we’ve analysed what is necessary for the minimal viable product.

                        <summary>Do you use AI graphics and media?</summary>
                        <p>
                            Absolutely not. With a decade of combined experience in software
                            development, music, graphic design, and dedication to artistic
                            development, we have the skills to give you a real, breathing
                            website with nuance and heart. Just like an online builder, AI
                            is an echo of every other website, useful for quick tasks, but
                            charmless in the long term. We’re offering something spontaneous
                            that reflects you and your team, so you stand out for who you
                            are.
